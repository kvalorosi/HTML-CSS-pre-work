                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <strong><small>Kaytlin Valorosi's Portfolio</small></strong>
                <p>My name is Kaytlin Valorosi, I currently live in the state of Washington. I have spent the last several years doing seasonal work around the western United States. Most of this work has been with the U.S. Forest Service and the Park Service doing trail maintenance and patrolling the wilderness. I have so many incredible memories being out in the woods the last several years, finding myself and really figuring out what I want to do in life. I currently live in a school bus with my boyfriend and our two dogs. The school bus allows us to travel on our days off and have everything we need at our fingertips, I must say it's really convenient having your house with you everywhere you go!</p>

            <h1>My Interests</h1>
            <strong><small>I enjoy spending most of my free time outdoors doing various activites</small></strong>
           
        <p>I <strong>love</strong> being outside in anyway that I can be. My favorite activites are mountain biking, Snowboarding, and hiking with my dogs. Living in a school bus allows us to travel around washington when we aren't working and explore all of the many wonders this amazing state has. In the last six months I have found a new interest that I've been slowly diving into and thats the world of coding. I've been using resources like Codecademy to immerse myself in all things coding. I've been learning HTML, a little CSS, and some JavaScript so far. I'm thrilled to be on this new venture, it seems the world of coders isn't so small afterall! I meet a fellow coder everywhere I go!</p>

            <p>I have traveled to a few other countries in the last several years. I liked Thailand so much I went back a second time! Traveling has allowed me to meet new people, try new foods, and see the most beautfiful landscapes you can imagine. I have a long list of places I plan to travel to.   </p>
